# VRH on Rails

### TODO:

* Testcases for rank.rb methods (game_count, points)
* Setup HTTPS (need certificate)
* Improve frontend
* Secure administration features
* Cleanup useless views, controller, tests (goals#show, goals#index, etc ..)
* Find a better font for numbers?
* Fix 'responsivness' of public#index
* Add more testcases (at least one per action)
* Fix default team logo (weird that it is the VRH's logo)

## Prerequisites

* Having championships and teams tables initialized
  * rake init:championships
  * rake init:teams
